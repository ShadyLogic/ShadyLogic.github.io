        DBC puts a major focus on pair programming, requiring that we pair with somebody at least 3 times a week, one of which is a guided, supervised session. For those who may not know, pair programming is when two programmers work together to solve a coding challenge, looking at the same code usually on the same machine. One person actually writes the code while the other looks out for mistakes and keeps a broader, big-picture perspective. I found it to be quite an experience, as one is forced to find clear ways of communicating such abstract ideas as program structure and logic.

        In the genre of science fiction the story sometimes takes place in an advanced society, one where many of the labor and service jobs once done by people are now done by robots. People in this world are often portrayed as living idyllic lives, free from the most menial tasks to focus on higher pursuits. In the real world we are already beginning to see machines doing jobs once done by humans, being both faster, safer, and more reliably than any person could be. Far from living an idyllic life, however, these people now find themselves jobless, their livelihoods stolen by a robot.

         Before we started the Dev Bootcamp Program we were asked to learn about Gregorc Thinking Styles, a way to model the mind's ability to perceive and order information. According to the theory, the mind possesses both concrete and abstract perceptive qualities, with variance between individuals. The mind also has varying ability to order information, both sequentially and randomly. We were asked to take a test that would measure these qualities in an empirical way, and it was quite interesting to learn the results.

        There was no cultural blog assigned this week, so I made a tribute to Zalgo instead. I used a zalgo generator to make the text for the title and link, and wrote a JavaScript function to scramble the paragraph text. I was going for a cool "corrupted file" look.

      When we were first given access to the curriculum for Week 1 I was surprised at how hands-off the course seemed. I knew that much of what we were learning would be self-taught, but I expected more involvement from the staff and teachers. At first I felt disappointed, thinking that if I was going to be teaching myself the material what did I need to pay $12k for? However, at the end of this week I have begun to see the true spirit and value of the program.
