        In the genre of science fiction the story sometimes takes place in an advanced society, one where many of the labor and service jobs once done by people are now done by robots. People in this world are often portrayed as living idyllic lives, free from the most menial tasks to focus on higher pursuits. In the real world we are already beginning to see machines doing jobs once done by humans, being both faster, safer, and more reliably than any person could be. Far from living an idyllic life, however, these people now find themselves jobless, their livelihoods stolen by a robot.

        As progress is made in artificial intelligence, the number of jobs able to be automated grows exponentially. Robots are driving our cars, building our manufactured goods, even checking out our groceries. The advent of self-driving vehicles spells the end of a huge number of transportation jobs. AI drivers have been shown to be significantly less prone to accidents than human drivers, in addition to being tireless and cheaper to employ. When faced with the decision to hire a fallible, imperfect human or a highly efficient machine, the choice is an economic no-brainer.

      <p>
        The real problem is, that this isn't a problem. In a capitalistic economy, this is not the displacement of workers, this is a reduction in liability. Replacing people with robots lowers costs and reduces risk, something that is unstoppable in our economic climate. To reference the documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">HUMANS NEED NOT APPLY</a>, nothing the horse could do would have prevented its replacement by the automobile.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of this is much solace for the people who will lose their jobs once the self-driving car revolutionizes the transportation industry, but there is little that can be done. Laws could be passed to guarantee human jobs in these sectors, but this would merely prolong the inevitable. The only real, practical solution is to read the writing on the wall and begin planning for a new career.
