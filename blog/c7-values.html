        We were given a list of words and asked to identify which of them came to mind when considering the happiest, proudest, or most satisfied we'd ever been. I chose the words above. We were also asked to rate, on a scale of 1 to 5, how much we try to live up to these values. I would give myself a score of 4 in that regard. The words I chose represent qualities that I value and hope to achieve greater embodiment of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the words I chose, I would say that Self-Reliance is the most important to me. Being able to support myself, independent of outside influence, has always been a driving force in my life. Most skills that I have today I gained by teaching myself, a skill that is the pinnacle of self-reliance. Those who are able to teach themselves let nothing stand in their way on the path to knowledge.

        When I think about my values my feelings are dependent upon my recent actions. If I have been living up to my core values it makes me feel strong and confident, whereas if I have not been living up to my values I feel ineffective and weak. I believe that living up to ones values is a valuable defense against stereotype threat. A strong sense of self-identity can help mitigate feelings external perception. When we know exactly who we are and what we stand for we stop caring as much how other people see us.
