        DBC puts a major focus on pair programming, requiring that we pair with somebody at least 3 times a week, one of which is a guided, supervised session. For those who may not know, pair programming is when two programmers work together to solve a coding challenge, looking at the same code usually on the same machine. One person actually writes the code while the other looks out for mistakes and keeps a broader, big-picture perspective. I found it to be quite an experience, as one is forced to find clear ways of communicating such abstract ideas as program structure and logic.

        Pair programming is actually a very intimate exercise. I find writing code to be a very personal thing, more so than creative writing or poetry. Code feels like the raw language of the brain, expressing logical thought and conceptual flow. When you code alone the program you write is a wholly singular thing, intimately connected with your thoughts, constructed and perceived completely within your mind. But when you pair with a partner to create code what you write together is not just a product of one.
      </p>

        When working with a partner there is a significant amount of discussion and compromise that happens throughout the process. In order to work together effectively there must be constant communication about the code. This proves to be a very effective means of catching mistakes, as any errors have the opportunity of being corrected be the pair, and design flaws are easier to spot when expressed verbally. I found my pairing sessions to be very stimulating, and it was immensely helpful to be able to see the problem from somebody else's perspective.
