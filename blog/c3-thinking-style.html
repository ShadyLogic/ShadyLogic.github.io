         Before we started the Dev Bootcamp Program we were asked to learn about Gregorc Thinking Styles, a way to model the mind's ability to perceive and order information. According to the theory, the mind possesses both concrete and abstract perceptive qualities, with variance between individuals. The mind also has varying ability to order information, both sequentially and randomly. We were asked to take a test that would measure these qualities in an empirical way, and it was quite interesting to learn the results.
      </p>
      <p>
          Concrete perception is our ability to register information using our five senses, in the moment, here and now. Concrete perception is not concerned with subtext or conceptualizing, only what it can see. Abstract perception, on the other hand, is the quality of being able to understand things that can't be seen, to look beyond the obvious to see the implication behind everything. Abstract thinking allows the perception of ideas and concepts within our mind.
      </p>
      <p>
          Our minds also possess both sequential and random ordering abilities. Sequential ordering is a linear, step-by-step approach to making sense of information. A person with strong sequential ordering skills might be very comfortable making a plan and following it, preferring a logical start-to-finish approach. In contrast, random ordering skills allow us to organize information in a more fluid manner, processing information in chunks. This gives us the ability to skip steps or work backwards when solving a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
          Although everybody possesses these perceptual and ordering qualities, over time we begin to develop a pattern that we feel comfortable using. The test we were given purports to measure our preferred style of thinking by giving us 4 words and asking us to choose the two that we feel best describes us. If you'd like to take the test yourself you can find a link <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">HERE</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
          I took the test and scored highest in the concrete-random category, which I feel is a fair assessment. According to the information provided I learn best when allowed to experiment and solve problems independently. It also warns that I may have a hard time with routines and keeping detailed records, things that I have indeed struggled with. Overall I found the model and test very accurate, and I will have to consider more closely how these things affect my ability to learn here at DBC.
      </p>
      <p>
          I created a Ruby command-line program that automates the Thinking Styles test, you can find it on the <a href="../projects/index.html">PROJECTS PAGE</a>.
