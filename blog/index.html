         My site is live! If you're reading this then you already know, because you're on it. Boy is CSS a pain in the butt. I've never used CSS or HTML before, and one week is a short amount of time to learn a whole new language. I think I did a pretty good job though. Anyway, I'm here to talk to you about CSS positioning, the only part of the language that gave me a headache. Let's begin!

        Welcome, neophytes, to the Holy Order of Git. Our sacred cabal is an ancient one that worships that fell beast known as The Great Instrument of Terror, or The Git. The Git is as frightening as it is powerful, but our coterie has long practiced the secrets of taming this monster. As an acolyte it is my job to teach you our ways and impart some basic knowledge such that you may survive your encounters with the beast.
