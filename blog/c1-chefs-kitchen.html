    <p>
      When we were first given access to the curriculum for Week 1 I was surprised at how hands-off the course seemed. I knew that much of what we were learning would be self-taught, but I expected more involvement from the staff and teachers. At first I felt disappointed, thinking that if I was going to be teaching myself the material what did I need to pay $12k for? However, at the end of this week I have begun to see the true spirit and value of the program.

      I could teach myself how to do a lot of this stuff, sure, but DBC provides direction and companions. Without the program I would not know what is and isn't important, and I would not have access to a community of like-minded people attempting to solve the same problems I am. This week we learned a lot. Not only Git and CLI, but what is expected of us as a culturally. The most surprising thing about this course so far has been the overwhelming emphasis on personal development, and I am grateful for that.
